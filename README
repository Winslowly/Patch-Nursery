Unit 2 Project- Full CRUD application

-Premise-

    This project is based around a collection of trees found in the Pacific NW.

-How I built it.
    I built a pre populated database with trees and links to related photos.  I then made a ejs file named index.ejs that would render the seed data that has been stored in the database.  The index.ejs page is linked to a "show" page that renders an individual collection of data relating to the tree selected.  on this page is presented two buttons: one to return to the index page and one to an edit page.   The Edit page contains the most functionality and is what I'm most pround of.  It has a form for updating information and the option to delete an entry.

-Things I did not accomplish but would like to.

    I spent quite a bit of time working on the DELETE route and button but was not able to get it working in time for submission.  Would love to check over that with an Instructor.

    The second thing that I wasn't able to complete was the edit function on my Edit page.  I had the form in place but also ran out of time to complete.
